**Professional Self-Assessment**  
While I normally don’t like to talk about how my personal life impacts my coursework, reaching the end makes me appreciative of what I was able to accomplish. Along the way I believe I lost confidence in my potential as a developer, but it’s important to remind myself that I completed the challenges presented before me while managing work, a daughter and various roadblocks that came along the way. Thanks to these challenges, I am confident that I have grown over my time in the program, both in programming and life. The coursework allowed me time to struggle at foundational concepts necessary to feel comfortable working on software projects. A wide range of comp-sci courses allowed me to explore my love for research beyond development. These courses that had me implement complex solutions were accompanied by courses that made me stop and consider the implications of my actions in the development lifecycle.  
My program experience included many opportunities to collaborate with classmates and instructors alike. Actively participating in group projects and learning the essentials of using version control, will be an invaluable skill moving forward as I plan to get involved in online communities that develop open source projects, a long-time dream of mine. These situations not only taught me the tools for collaboration, but rounded out my communication skills in these settings. The comfortability I feel in consulting others for help is a result of learning how to prepare my questions with research. This gives me the feeling that there isn’t anything I’m incapable of solving eventually.  
	Overall, the program experience gave me opportunities to prove my understanding of software practices, data structures and algorithms and security as a mindset. Coming from a background in networking and system admin, security concepts were always on my mind, but learning how to implement them in software was a significant challenge. Software practices feel obvious, yet they require that level of reinforcement to be truly appreciated. Finally, the work involving data structures and algorithms showed me how fun programming can be. It showed me the potential for my creativity to be harnessed, and for that I am truly grateful to the SNHU Comp-Sci program, and all the instructors who helped along the way.  
	Using the WeightTracker Application and exploring the use of Firebase gives me a great launching point to continue growth on my ePortfolio. While I don’t feel it is completely ready now, I feel that I designed potential into every change that I made. As I move forward, I plan to use GitHub to consistently track feature updates for my application as I plan to expand it far beyond the current functionality. Hopefully, the migration of user authentication and data persistence to firebase services can highlight the foundational skills that I learned through my coursework. The data visualization elements have me excited to consider other creative ways for me to implement what I’ve learned from data structures and algorithm concepts.
