**Android Mobile App: Weight Tracker**  
The Weight Tracker Android mobile application was initially developed for CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming. The initial state of the app was nowhere near a scalable solution. Even so, the project was able to get me familiar with the essentials of Android development. I learned to implement the design patterns that can connect application logic with an Android user interface. This practice made it much easier to migrate my backend services to Firebase, while I expanded the complexity of the project with additional items for user data and the inclusion of data visualization. The initial concepts learned in CS-360 allowed me to design my project in a way that carries greater potential over time as I learn more.   
**Software Design and Engineering:** **User Authentication with Firebase Auth**  
I chose to use FirebaseAuth because of the immense potential it provides for my mobile application. My previous application could not truly be judged for its user authentication because it didn’t really have anything considerable. With FirebaseAuth I can explore the Firebase console to first learn about what features users might want for their accounts, then I can implement them quickly into my application. The first step was to make my authentication method that could be called across the application to get the state of the user account. The potential exists in the ability to add security, sign-in providers, account personalization and utilize the extensive user management dashboard.  
**Algorithms and Data Structures:** **Data Visualization**

I chose to provide a data visualization element for the users to view their weight entries because of the potential it provides my application. The original application didn’t have any data manipulation to speak of, so this was a large improvement. The first step was to learn how to use MPAndroidChart, and prepare the data to be displayed on a line chart. After creating methods that enabled me to add filters and time periods for the line chart, there still exists a great deal of potential in the additional health metrics we added to the program. These can be incorporated into the data visualization when I can decide on creative ways to correlate different metrics. 

**Databases:** **Data Persistence with Firebase Firestore**  
	I chose to transition to Firebase Firestore with the similar idea of future potential for my application. Switching from a local SQLite database to a cloud-based solution was much simpler than it should be. With Firestore I can learn more about NoSQL data modeling capabilities while I benefit from real-time synchronization. Similar to my FirebaseAuth, I modified my existing CRUD methods to leverage the Firestore services. I’m happy with this design choice, although it was easier than other methods, because of the Firestore dashboard and analytics I’m provided with. Also learning about the Firestore batch.write methods helped me to generate a year’s worth of user data to test out my newly implemented data visualization.
